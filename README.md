## Quick Start

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init
```

That's it. Launch Copilot CLI with experimental mode (`copilot --experimental`) in any repo and trigger the extension with **`@cloud-networking`** followed by what you need:

```
@cloud-networking design a hub-spoke VNet topology for a 3-tier app across dev/staging/prod
```

```
@cloud-networking generate Palo Alto rules to allow HTTPS from my app subnet to a backend on port 8443
```

The coordinator picks the right specialist automatically and responds in plain language — no tool names to remember.

## What is Cloud Networking?

Cloud Networking gives you a coordinated team of network specialist agents through [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli). Describe what you need — VNet design, firewall rules, DNS troubleshooting, hybrid connectivity, IaC generation, container networking, SASE architecture — and the coordinator routes your request to the right specialist automatically.

Each specialist runs with its own domain expertise, guardrails, and workflow. The coordinator handles routing and multi-domain orchestration so you don't have to remember which tools to call.

> **Analysis only** — Cloud Networking produces designs, configurations, IaC templates, and analysis for human review. It generates deployment code but does not execute deployments, modify live firewalls, or make changes to production networks.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [GitHub Copilot CLI](https://docs.github.com/copilot/concepts/agents/about-copilot-cli) installed and authenticated
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Experimental mode** (user-level install only) — enable with `copilot --experimental` or `/experimental` inside Copilot CLI. Not needed for project-level install (`init --project`)

### Option A — User-level install (recommended)

The fastest way to install globally. Extensions load in every repo but require **experimental mode**:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init
```

Then launch Copilot with experimental mode:

```bash
copilot --experimental
```

This will:
1. Create `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/` if it doesn't exist
2. Copy the extension router and all 19 specialists
3. Remove any conflicting individual specialist extensions
4. Display a summary of what was installed

### Option B — Project-level install (no experimental mode needed)

Installs the extension into the current repo's `.github/extensions/` directory. Works without experimental mode, but only for this repo.

> **Important:** You must run this from inside a git repository. If you don't have one yet, run `git init` first.

```bash
# cd into your repo first
cd my-repo
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init --project
```

Then launch Copilot normally from the repo:

```bash
copilot
```

This will:
1. Create `.github/extensions/cloud-networking/` in the current repo
2. Copy the extension router and all 19 specialists
3. Add the extension directory to `.gitignore` (each developer runs init themselves)

### Option C — Global install via npm

If you prefer a persistent CLI command instead of `npx`:

```bash
npm install -g github:dmauser/cloud-networking

# User-level install (requires experimental mode)
cloud-networking init

# Or project-level install (no experimental mode needed)
cloud-networking init --project

# Now available as a command:
cloud-networking status
cloud-networking --version
```

### Option D — Install from inside Copilot CLI

Already have Copilot CLI open? You can install directly from the prompt — just ask Copilot to clone the repo and run the installer for you:

```
Clone https://github.com/dmauser/cloud-networking.git and run `node bin/cli.mjs init` from the cloned directory.
```

Or if you already cloned the repo and are inside it:

```
Run `node bin/cli.mjs init` to install the cloud-networking extensions.
```

Copilot will execute the commands, copy the extensions into `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/`, and confirm the result. After installation, restart Copilot CLI to load the new extensions, then verify with:

```
show me the cloud-networking capabilities
```

### Option E — Manual install (offline / corporate environments)

<details>
<summary>Click to expand manual steps</summary>

Use this if you're behind a corporate proxy or don't have access to npm/npx.

**Step 1 — Clone the repo:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmauser/cloud-networking.git
cd cloud-networking
```

**Step 2 — Copy to your Copilot extensions directory:**

macOS / Linux:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking
cp -r extensions/cloud-networking/* ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
$dest = "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\cloud-networking"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path $dest | Out-Null
Copy-Item -Path "extensions\cloud-networking\*" -Destination $dest -Recurse -Force
```

**Step 3 — Verify the files are in place:**

```bash
ls ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
# Should show: extension.mjs  specialists/
```

</details>

### Verify installation

After any install method, check that everything is in place:

```bash
# If you used Option A or B:
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking status

# Or launch Copilot CLI and ask:
copilot
> show me the cloud-networking capabilities
```

You should see all 19 specialists listed with their tools.

### Updating

The extension automatically checks GitHub for a newer version on each session start (throttled to once every 24h, fully non-blocking, never blocks load). When an update is available, you'll see a one-line `cloud-networking: update available — installed X.Y.Z, latest A.B.C` notice in the session log.

To update, run the **`update`** command — it auto-detects whether you have a user-level install, a project-level install (in the current repo), or both, and re-installs each in place:

```bash
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking update
```

Equivalent shortcuts (any of these re-pulls the latest):

```bash
# Re-run init explicitly (replaces the existing install)
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init             # user-level
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking init --project   # project-level

# If installed globally
npm install -g github:dmauser/cloud-networking
cloud-networking update
```

**Opt out of auto-check.** Set the environment variable `CLOUD_NETWORKING_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable the periodic GitHub poll entirely.

Each install records its version in `<install-dir>/.install-meta.json`, and `cloud-networking status` will display it alongside the install date.

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for what's new in each release.

### Uninstall

```bash
# Using the CLI:
npx github:dmauser/cloud-networking uninstall

# Or manually:
# macOS / Linux
rm -rf ~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking
# Windows (PowerShell)
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\.copilot\extensions\cloud-networking"
```

## CLI Reference

The `cloud-networking` CLI manages installation of the Copilot extensions. You can run it via `npx` or install it globally.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `cloud-networking init` | Install/reinstall extensions to `~/.copilot/extensions/` |
| `cloud-networking init --project` | Install extensions to `.github/extensions/` in current repo |
| `cloud-networking update` | Re-install over any existing user-level and/or project-level install (pulls latest from GitHub) |
| `cloud-networking status` | Check installation status, version, and list available specialists |
| `cloud-networking uninstall` | Remove installed extensions |
| `cloud-networking --version` | Print the installed CLI version |
| `cloud-networking help` | Show CLI help |

The extension also performs an **automatic update check** against GitHub once every 24 hours when a Copilot session starts, and prints a one-line notice if a newer version is available. Set `CLOUD_NETWORKING_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` to disable.

## How It Works

Trigger the extension with **`@cloud-networking`** anywhere in your prompt. The coordinator detects the mention, picks the right specialist(s) based on what you ask, loads their role and skills behind the scenes, and replies in natural language.

```
You: @cloud-networking design a hub-spoke VNet with Azure Firewall and
     monitor east-west traffic with flow logs

         │
         ▼
   ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
   │ Cloud Networking coordinator                                │
   │ • Detects @cloud-networking mention                         │
   │ • Identifies multi-domain intent:                           │
   │     VNet design · Firewall · Network monitoring             │
   │ • Engages the matching specialists in sequence              │
   └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
   Specialists run their domain workflows and the coordinator
   stitches the answer together in plain language.
```

You never need to call individual tools — just describe what you need after `@cloud-networking` and the coordinator handles the rest.

### Installed extension structure

After running `cloud-networking init`, the installed layout mirrors the `extensions/cloud-networking/` tree above:

```
~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/
├── extension.mjs                          # Router + auto-routing hook
└── specialists/                           # All 19 specialist directories
    └── (same structure as above)
```

### Specialist directory conventions

All specialists follow a standard layout:

```
specialist-name/
├── agents/
│   └── specialist-name.md    # Agent persona, workflow, guardrails
└── skills/
    ├── skill-name/
    │   └── SKILL.md          # Detailed skill instructions
    └── another-skill/
        └── SKILL.md
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Extensions not loading (`/env` shows "Extensions: none") | Enable experimental mode: `copilot --experimental` — or use project-level install: `cloud-networking init --project` |
| Tools not appearing after install | Restart Copilot CLI to reload extensions |
| `@cloud-networking` doesn't engage | Verify `~/.copilot/extensions/cloud-networking/extension.mjs` exists; run `cloud-networking status` |
| Specialist tools missing | Run `cloud-networking status` to check — should list all 19 specialists |
| Conflicting individual extensions | Run `cloud-networking init` — it removes old standalone specialist installs |
| `npx` hangs or fails | Use Option E (manual install) — clone the repo and copy files directly |
| Firewall config for unsupported vendor | Check the [14 supported vendors](#firewall-vendors-14) list |
| Version mismatch after update | Run `cloud-networking status` — compare CLI version vs installed version |
